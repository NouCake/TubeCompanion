How do threads work with node?
how do scaling web apps work?

multiple users should be able do request downloads.
server shouldnt block while downloading and doesn't have to download multiple files at once.
but server should be possible to send files to multiple users parallel.

so maybe there should always be a thread listening to new incoming calls.
does socket.io already do this? idk
